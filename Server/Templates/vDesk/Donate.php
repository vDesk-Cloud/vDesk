    <h3>Who the heck made all this stuff?</h3>
    <p>
        If you're wondering who's the person behind this project, let me answer this question and introduce myself:

        Hi, I'm Kerry!<br><br>
        I am a passionate PHP-, JS-, C#- and SQL-developer living in the beautiful and castle-rich german federal state of "Hessen" and I'm the author of this huge pile of source
        code to hopefully <strike>conquer</strike> support the world.<br><br>
        Roundabout 7 years ago, I just started to develop a stupid file-cloud with a bit drag&drop support and folder structures where I can just throw in my files and access them
        from anywhere.<br>
        Because I had a lot of ideas for additional features, I constantly kept on developing and improving the system in my freetime.<br><br>
        In the meantime, vDesk became kind of a "playground" for me, where I can try out new technologies and improve my skills as a developer.<br>
        After many years of figuring out the best way to develop and continuously refactoring<br> I've reached a point, where I thought "hey, maybe someone could use it all" and
        finally took the step to release
        vDesk to the public.<br><br>

        vDesk has now reached such a scale that it is no longer easy to work on it alone.<br>
        Therefore I have the hope to create a great community, creating together an even greater project.<br>
        <br>
        PS: I'm hoping this project never won't punish any commercial developers over the work day which have to deal with crappy APIs and packages.<br>
        ...I've come to know deep technical abysses in the past with certain enterprise "Document Management Systems"<br>
        <br>
        So you may wonder why I made a cloud system with a bit of an "enterprise" and "collaborative" touch?<br>
        <br>
        Well, at least I would say, I know how you shouldn't do it, but after all; it makes a lot of fun developing "fancy stuff" ðŸ˜….
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Many thanks in advance for your support!<br>
        - Kerry
    </p>
