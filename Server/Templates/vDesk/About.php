        <h3>What is vDesk?</h3>
        <p>
            Well... this question I would've answered around 10 years ago with
            <span style="font-style: italic">"A simple cloud with a bit drag&drop support and folder navigation"</span>,<br>
            but in the meantime it would be easier to ask what it's not.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, the most fitting term would be a self hosted "groupware" written in PHP and JavaScript with a configurable featureset powered by vDesk's package system.
        </p>
        <p>
            At least i can tell it lets me access my archived files, important dates and contacts and quickly wrote down notes from anywhere hosted on a RasPi 4 with a pair of SSDs attached.
            <br>I'm organizing important events and write down quick notes or writing down a shopping list.
            store bills and important data, music and pictures

        <p>
            In the meantime I started to control and survey my paludaria with an unreleased  <a href="https://github.com/vDesk-Cloud/vDesk/tree/GPIO-1.0.0">GPIO</a> package
            distributed over a small self written <a href="https://github.com/vDesk-Cloud/vDesk/tree/Relay-1.0.0">message queue system</a>,
            both driven by the <a href="<?= Functions::URL("vDesk", "Page", "Packages#Machines") ?>">Machines</a> package.

            If you're wondering who's the person behind this project, let me answer this question and introduce myself:<br>
            Hi, I'm Kerry!<br><br>
            I'm the cause of this huge pile of code.
            I am a passionate PHP-, JS-, C#- and SQL-developer living in the beautiful and castle-rich german federal state of "Hessen" and I'm the author of this huge pile of source
            code to hopefully <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">conquer</span> support the world.<br><br>

            <br>
            PS: I'm hoping this project never won't punish any commercial developers over the work day which have to deal with crappy APIs and packages.<br>
            ...I've come to know deep technical abysses in the past with certain enterprise "Document Management Systems"<br>
            <br>
            So you may wonder why I made a cloud system with a bit of an "enterprise" and "collaborative" touch?<br>
            <br>
            Well, at least I would say, I know how you shouldn't do it, but after all; it makes a lot of fun developing "fancy stuff" ðŸ˜….

        <h3>How this mess started</h3>
        <p>
            It all started with the need for a simple password protected cloud system where i can just throw in my files and access them from anywhere.<br>
            But because I had a constant flow of new ideas for additional features, I kept on developing and improving the system in my freetime until it became, what iti is now.
        </p>
        <p>
            While development, vDesk became kind of a "playground" for me, where I can try out new technologies and improve my skills as a developer.<br>
            After many years of figuring out the best way to develop and continuously refactoring,<br>
            I've reached a point, where I thought "hey, maybe someone could use it all" and
            finally took the step to release vDesk to the public.
        </p>
        <p>
            vDesk has now reached such a scale that it is no longer easy to work on it alone.<br>
            Therefore I have the hope to lay the foundation for a great community, creating together an even greater project.<br>
